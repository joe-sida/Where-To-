            <h1>Bale Mountains National Park</h1>
            <h3>Bale Mountains National Park (BMNP) is a spectacular natural reserve in southeastern Ethiopia, covering approximately 2,150 km² (830 sq mi) in the Bale Mountains and Sanetti Plateau of the Ethiopian Highlands. Renowned for its rich biodiversity and high level of endemic species, the park was added to the World Heritage Tentative List in 2009.</h3>

<p><strong>Geography and Hydrology</strong></p>

<p>Located 400 km southeast of Addis Ababa and 150 km east of Shashamene in the Oromia Region National State, BMNP spans five woredas: Adaba, Dinsho, Goba, Delo-Mena-Angetu, and Harena-Buluk. The park's geographical coordinates are 6º29' – 7º10'N and 39º28' – 39º57'E.</p>

<p>The Bale Mountains are crucial for regional climate control, attracting substantial orographic rainfall. This hydrological importance is highlighted by the 40 rivers originating within the park, feeding into major rivers like the Web, Wabe Shebele, Welmel, Dumal, and Ganale. These rivers are vital for over 12 million people in Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia. The highland areas also support numerous springs, essential for both wildlife and local communities, and have hydroelectric schemes on the Wabe Shebele and Yadot rivers.</p>

<p><strong>Climate</strong></p>

<p>Temperatures in BMNP vary significantly: the Sanetti Plateau averages around 10 °C (50 °F) with strong winds, the Gaysay Valley around 20 °C (68 °F), and the Harenna Forest around 25 °C (77 °F). Weather changes frequently, with night frosts common above 3,000 meters. The rainy season lasts from May to November.</p>

<p><strong>Ecology</strong></p>

<p><strong>Habitats</strong></p>

<p>BMNP encompasses five distinct habitats:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Northern Grasslands (Gaysay Valley)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Northern Juniper Woodlands (Park Headquarters)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Afro-alpine Meadows (Sanetti Plateau)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Erica Moorlands</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Harenna Forest</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>These habitats range from grasslands at around 3,000 meters to Mount Tullu Demtu, Ethiopia's second highest peak at 4,377 meters. The Sanetti Plateau is the largest continuous area of Afro-alpine moorland in Africa, featuring lichen-covered rocks and Giant lobelia. The Harenna Forest, cloaked in fog, is a woodland of moss-draped trees, rich in elusive wildlife.</p>

<p><strong>Flora</strong></p>

<p>The park's flora includes waist-high wildflowers, grasses, East African pencil juniper, tree heath, and the wild forest coffee (Coffea arabica). Medicinal plants, such as hagenia, are used locally to treat ailments like tapeworms.</p>

<p><strong>Fauna</strong></p>

<p>BMNP is home to several threatened and endemic species:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mammals</strong>: Ethiopian wolf, Mountain nyala, big-headed African mole-rat, Menelik's bushbuck, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Birds</strong>: Over 282 species, including nine endemic to Ethiopia, such as the blue-winged goose and Abyssinian catbird.</li>
  <li><strong>Reptiles</strong>: Ethiopian House snake, Bale two-horned chameleon, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Amphibians</strong>: Seven endemic species, including the Ethiopian burrowing tree frog and Bale Mountain Frog.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People of Bale</strong></p>

<p>The Bale region's population is predominantly Oromo-speaking farmers and cattle herders, with approximately 1.5 million people. Afan Oromo is the primary language, and the main religions are Islam (77%), Orthodox Christianity (20%), and Protestantism (1%).</p>

<p>The Oromo people, pastoralists and farmers, follow traditional practices like the transhumance system (Godantu), moving livestock to higher grounds during crop-growing seasons. Their homes, known as “mana citaa,” are circular, made from juniper or eucalyptus, and thatched with grass or stubble.</p>

<p><strong>Visiting Bale Mountains National Park</strong></p>

<p>BMNP offers visitors a unique glimpse into Ethiopia's natural beauty and cultural heritage. From exploring diverse habitats and observing endemic wildlife to experiencing local traditions, BMNP provides an enriching and unforgettable adventure in the heart of Ethiopia.</p>
