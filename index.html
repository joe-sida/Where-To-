                            The gelada, or bleeding-heart monkey, thrives uniquely in Ethiopia's Highlands. With buff to dark brown fur, males sport red chest patches while females develop fluid-filled blisters during estrus. Living in high-altitude bands, they form complex societies of reproductive units and male groups, centered around a grassy diet. Despite declines, they're presently least concern, cherished for their distinct habitat and social dynamics.
